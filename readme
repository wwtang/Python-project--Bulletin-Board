Name: Bulletin Board python cgi project.
from book Python from novice to professional.

In this project I used mysql as backend database.

Uasge:
deposit all the files into your cgi-bin directory and grant them with permissions,
and visit 'localhost/cgi-bin/main.cgi' in your browser. This programme should works well.
